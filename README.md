FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- we need an intermediate layer between the client and the microservices
- Using the middle end when client send request we will be able to make decision that which microservices
- We can do message validation, response validation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
